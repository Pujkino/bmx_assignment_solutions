# 1.) What type of inheritance does Ruby have?

Inheritance is a relation between two classes, superclass and subclass. All the properties form superclass is applicable to subclass but subclass can also have it's own features.

There are two types of inheritance:
1.) single inheritance - class can inherit from single other class

## example
class Animals  
    def super_method 
        puts "Method of superclass"
    end
end
  
class Dogs < Animals  
    def initialize  
       puts "This is subclass"
    end
end

Dogs.new.super_method 

______________output______________
This is subclass
Method of superclass


2.) multilevel inheritance - when class B inherits from class A, and class C inherits from class B, class C gets all properties from class B and class B gets all properties from class A. In ruby it's possible only with the use of Mixin. We create a module with it's defined methods and then we include a module inside a class.

##example
require_relative "module_ruby"

<!-- example.rb -->
class Animals  
    def super_method 
        puts "Method of superclass"
    end
end
  
class Dogs < Animals  
    include Introduction
    include TypeOfDog
    include Perk
end

Dogs.new.method_1
Dogs.new.method_2
Dogs.new.method_3

<!-- module_ruby.rb -->
module Introduction
    def method_1
        puts "hey, I'm dog"
    end  
end

module TypeOfDog
    def method_2
      puts "Dog is a Golden retriver"
    end  
end

module Perk
    def method_3
        puts "hey, I am faithful"
    end
end

______________output______________
hey, I'm dog
Dog is a Golden retriver
hey, I am faithful

One of the downsides of inheritance is method overriding. In method overriding, subclass and superclass may have the same methodâ€™s name, but performing different tasks. In that case one method overrides another method. If superclass contains as same method's name as subclass then subclass method will get executed.

#example
class Animals 
    def method_1 
        puts "This is Superclass Method" 
    end 
end 
  
class Dogs < Animals    
    def method_1
        puts "This is Subclass Method" 
    end 
end 
     
Dogs.new.method_1

______________output______________
This is Subclass Method
