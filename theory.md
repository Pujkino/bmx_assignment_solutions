# 1.) What type of inheritance does Ruby have?

Inheritance is a relation between two classes, superclass and subclass. All the properties form superclass is applicable to subclass but subclass can also have it's own features.

There are two types of inheritance:
1.) single inheritance - class can inherit from single other class

## example
class Animals  
    def super_method 
        puts "Method of superclass"
    end
end
  
class Dogs < Animals  
    def initialize  
       puts "This is subclass"
    end
end

Dogs.new.super_method 

______________output______________
This is subclass
Method of superclass


2.) multilevel inheritance - when class B inherits from class A, and class C inherits from class B, class C gets all properties from class B and class B gets all properties from class A. In ruby it's possible only with the use of Mixin. We create a module with it's defined methods and then we include a module inside a class.

##example
require_relative "module_ruby"

<!-- example.rb -->
class Animals  
    def super_method 
        puts "Method of superclass"
    end
end
  
class Dogs < Animals  
    include Introduction
    include TypeOfDog
    include Perk
end

Dogs.new.method_1
Dogs.new.method_2
Dogs.new.method_3

<!-- module_ruby.rb -->
module Introduction
    def method_1
        puts "hey, I'm dog"
    end  
end

module TypeOfDog
    def method_2
      puts "Dog is a Golden retriver"
    end  
end

module Perk
    def method_3
        puts "hey, I am faithful"
    end
end

______________output______________
hey, I'm dog
Dog is a Golden retriver
hey, I am faithful

One of the downsides of inheritance is method overriding. In method overriding, subclass and superclass may have the same methodâ€™s name, but performing different tasks. In that case one method overrides another method. If superclass contains as same method's name as subclass then subclass method will get executed.

#example
class Animals 
    def method_1 
        puts "This is Superclass Method" 
    end 
end 
  
class Dogs < Animals    
    def method_1
        puts "This is Subclass Method" 
    end 
end 
     
Dogs.new.method_1

______________output______________
This is Subclass Method



# 2.) Which iteration is more idiomatic?
    # A
    [1, 2, 3].each { |number| p number * 10 }

    # B
    for number in [1, 2, 3]
        p number * 10
    end
    What is happening behind the scenes in each case (basic explanation)?


#explaining A
Here we have a single-line block. An array consists of 3 elements 1,2,3. We use .each method that iterates over every single element in array, in order. Block variable - |number| - represents each element in the array. Then, each item is multiple by 10. .each method is preferred because it's more secure. Anything that exists within the block exists only within local scope.

#explaining B
Number represent a block variable that iterates over every single item in array and prints out every item multiplied by 10. For loop is almost equivalent to an each loop but it does not create a new scope for local variables. There is a new unecessary line of code, as well, which makes code redundant.

If the code fits on one line, then is preferrble using single-line block.
